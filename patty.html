			<p><b>BIO:</b><br>
				Hi, my name is Patricia Berryhill, I was born in 1970 in Lansing Michigan. I have always enjoyed art. From kindergarden to collage I took art classes in all forms ranging from wood shop to pottery, drafting, and of course drawing.<br><br> 
				I didn't have any tattoos until i was 21. When I went over and showed my mom, she look at it and said, "What are you going to do, become a tattooed lady?" I laughed and said "No mom, its only one tattoo" HaHa (look at me now). <br><br> 
				In 1994 my ex boyfriend started his tattoo apprenticeship. Without even meaning to, I found myself at his side learning right along with him . I started setting up for him, drawing, and doing his stencils. Practically everything needed, except applying the stencil and doing the tattoo. I decided I needed to practice on some fruit (grapefruit and oranges are similar to skin) and see if i could do this too. Next thing I knew, I was tattooing! I did my first tattoo in 1997. I was shaking like a leaf, on a tree, in a tornado. I shook so badly people would call me Don Knotts because of it. Finally, I laid the first line and found "I can do this!" <br><br> 
				Over the past 16 years i have attended and tattooed at many canventions. My good friend Hawk invited me to most of them. I have tattooed at Shades of Blue, Slinging Ink, Harvest Moon Tattoo Festival, and Laconia Bike Week to name a few. I have also won a few awards over the years.<br><br> 
				I tattoo everything from beauty marks to full back pieces, froI inside the lip and ear to the weenis (your elbow skin, dirty mind!) and then some! i have worked in a few shops and even owned my own shop. I have been here at Liquid Tattoo for the past 10 years. <br><br> 
				I wouldnt want to do anything else. Tattooing has been a very enjoyable and I have met many people over the years. You may forget a face for a minute, but you always remember the tattoos!!<br><br>
