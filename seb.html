			<p><b>BIO:</b><br>
			Let me tell you about myself. My name is Sebastian Kinne. I was born on December 29th, 1991 and raised right here in Lansing, MI. I spent my childhood skateboarding and teaching myself to play the guitar. <br><br>
	Since pretty early on I can remember always being very intrigued by body modification. I even began stretching my ear in junior high. My parents, while I was growing up, were never too keen on the idea of tattoos or piercings. This being so, and knowing the huge risk of getting it done unprofessionally, I was unable to indulge myself in much modification until I was eighteen. However, on my eighteenth birthday I was right here at Liquid Tattoo getting my first tattoo.<br><br>
	Not long into the summer right after I graduated high school and a few tattoos later, all from Liquid, I was offered an apprenticeship right here. I spent about a year learning the skill in every bit of spare time I had outside of my job. Immediately after my apprenticeship, just by circumstance, I was thrust into full time as the only piercer here at Liquid. Now, another two years later, I am still very early on in my career but I can't see myself doing anything else at any point. What I do is not only a job but it's a passion. <br><br>
	They say if you love what you do, then you never work a day in your life. It may be cliche but that is how I feel. So come on in and see me, I'd love to poke a hole in you.<br><br>
