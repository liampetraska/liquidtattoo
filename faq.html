			<p><b>Do tattoos hurt?</b><br>
			Getting tattoo is a one of a kind feeling. Pain and irritation varies from person to person, but you will live, and with a cool new tattoo.<br><br>

			<b>Is it safe?</b><br>
			Yes. Liquid Tattoo is licensed by the State Of Michigan. At Liquid Tattoo we take great care in the safety of all our clients tattoo procedures. Every employee is  trained and certified in CPR, First Aid, and Bloodborne Pathogens. We use single use needles. We clean all equipment after each tattoo. We package and autoclave each instrument. All other equipment is disposable. <br><br>

			<b>How do I take care of my tattoo?</b><br>
			After your tattoo has been finished your artist will go over the aftercare with you.  Please listen carefully and follow their instructions, after you leave our studio it is up to you to take care of your new ink. You can also find aftercare instructions posted here on the website.<br><br>

			<b>How do I set up an appointment?</b><br>
			It is best to phone the studio at 517.346.7702 during our regular business hours to check availability. <br><br>

			<b>How does the consult work?</b><br>
			Should you or the artist choose to have a consultation before you get the tattoo, we will discuss ideas and form a plan. The consult is free but sometimes a drawing fee maybe collected at this time. The drawing fee reflects the amount of prep work the artist will need to achieve the desired art and wil be a percentage of the cost of the tattoo. This fee is non refundable should you make an appointment and no-show.<br><br>

			<b>How can I pay?</b><br>
			Liquid Tattoo accepts cash, credit, and debit cards. No personal checks please.<br><br>

			<b>How much does a tattoo cost?</b><br>
			It all depends on size, detail and complexity. Our shop minimum is $25.00, and goes up from there. It is often beneficial for larger tattoos to be priced by the hour. Should this be the case, your artist will discuss thier hourly rate. Good tattoos are not cheap. And Cheap tattoos are usually not very good.<br><br>
