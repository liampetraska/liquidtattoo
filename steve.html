			<p><b>BIO:</b><br>
			My name is Steve Carian, a.k.a. Lil' Steve, Bossman, and Instigator. I was born and raised in Lansing MI. and have been tattooing in the area professionally since 1998.A whooping 15 years.<br><br>

			My artistic life started far before then, I really started to take art seriously when I was 11 in the fifth grade. I loved to draw and knew I had to do something with it. Through school I wanted to become an architect and followed that route for a few years only to find myself  restricted to blueprints and CAD key programs. After moving on from that, I started taking sculpture and pottery classes, followed by pastels and airbrushing.  All the while, I had a love for tattooing, and started getting tattooed when I was 17. From there my new life had begun. I was hooked, and shortly after I purchased my own equipment. <br><br>

			To make a long story short I was in the right place at the right time and landed a job at "A Cool Tattoo For You", owned by Dale and Rene. I worked there for almost two years before leaving to open "Minds Eye Tattoo Studio" with Justin Platte, Jimmy Hannah, and Chad Diamond. I left that location to work for Hawk at "Liquid Tattoo". In 2001, after being there almost a year I was presented with the opportunity to purchase the business.  I have been owner since May 13, 2002.<br><br>

			I'm grateful for the opportunity I was givin by Hawk, and thankful for everyone who has helped Liquid Tattoo become the studio it is today.<br><br>
